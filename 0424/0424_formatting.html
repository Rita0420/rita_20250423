    <h3>a thousand year</h3>
    <p>
        <!-- b vs strong / i vs em -->
        <!-- strong em是有語意的標籤 -->
        <b>Heart</b> beats fast<br>
        Colors and promises<br>
        How to be brave?<br>
        How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?<br>
        But watching you stand alone<br>
        All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow<br>
        One step closer<br>
        I have died every day waiting for you<br>
        Darling, don't be afraid<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more<br>
        Time stands still<br>
        Beauty in all she is<br>
        I will be brave<br>
        I will not let anything take away<br>
        What's standing in front of me<br>
        Every breath, every hour has come to this<br>
        One step closer<br>
        I have died every day waiting for you<br>
        Darling, don't be afraid<br>
        I have loved you for <mark>a thousand years</mark><br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more<br>
        And all along I believed I would find you<br>
        Time has brought your heart to me<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more<br>
        One step closer<br>
        One step closer<br>
        I have died every day waiting for you<br>
        Darling, don't be afraid<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more<br>
        And all along I believed I would find you<br>
        Time has brought your heart to me<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more<br>
        <mark>hello</mark><br>
